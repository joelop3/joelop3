# 💻 Technical Autonomy Across Technologies

This document is a self-assessment of my autonomy and experience across a broad range of technologies I've worked with throughout my full-stack development career. The technologies are grouped into four main categories: **Frontend**, **Backend**, **DevOps/Infrastructure**, and **Fullstack/Shared**.

Rather than assigning numeric scores, I've indicated the tools and frameworks where I feel confident and autonomous, based on hands-on experience in production environments.

In some cases, while my direct experience with a specific tool may be limited, I rely on strong transferable knowledge from related technologies. For example:
- Although I’ve had limited exposure to **Drizzle** and **Prisma**, my background with ORMs such as **Eloquent**, **Doctrine**, and **SQLModel** allows me to work with them effectively.
- Similarly, tools like **Docker Bake** and **Podman Compose** are easy to pick up due to extensive experience with **Docker** and **Docker Compose**.

This list reflects the technologies I use regularly or have a solid foundation in, depending on the context and project requirements.
