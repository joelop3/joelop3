# Autonomy on different langs, technologies, command lines and other stuff

This is a self-evaluation of my proficiency and autonomy across various technologies and tools I've worked with throughout my full-stack development career. The technologies are grouped into different profiles: Frontend, Backend, DevOps/Infra, and Fullstack/Shared.

The scale ranges from 0 to 10, where 0 represents no knowledge or experience with the technology, and 10 represents full autonomy and deep experience. I have also left out a score for certain technologies (ranging from 0-3) where I either have very little experience or have not had the opportunity to work extensively with them.

I feel confident with all the technologies listed, even those with lower autonomy scores. My experience with similar tools in different languages or ecosystems allows me to adapt quickly. For example, while my autonomy with Drizzle and Prisma is lower, my deep experience with SQL databases and ORMs in Eloquent (Laravel), SQLModel (FastAPi) and Doctrine (Symfony) ensures I can apply these tools effectively. Likewise, my solid knowledge of Docker and Docker Compose makes it easy to learn alternatives like Docker Bake or Podman Compose. My ability to transfer knowledge across technologies gives me confidence, even with less direct experience.

This list reflects the tools and tech stacks I use on a day-to-day basis or have at least a foundational understanding of, depending on the project needs.
